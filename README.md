# chupacabra
A Simple Online Game Backend in Python

The story of this package started with a simple idea. Gaming websites have been on the web basically since there has been a web. How might someone go about designing and building a backend for a simple gaming website? 
What would the public API look like? What about the overall backend architecture. 
As I build this project, I hope to build a system that answers these questions in a way that is simple enough to be able to clearly explain my choices.

I make no promises about performance or security, so I wouldn't use this in a real website. But, it will hopefully work on a laptop and could maybe even be used to play games on a local network. Again, the idea of this is to build a working tutorial not to build a full enterprise solution.

## FAQ
 
 1) **Q:** Why chupacabra? **A:** Why not?
 2) **Q:** Can I use this at work without getting caught? **A:** I wouldn't recommend it.
 3) **Q:** Is this useful for a real web backend? **A:** I would strongly recommend against deploying this in the wild, as I have not tried to actually make sure that anything here is secure.
 4) **Q:** So then what is it useful for? **A:** I see this as more of a tutorial about how to design something like this. That said, I'm also a physicist so that doesn't mean that it'll work as well as the many actual gaming websites that exist.
